Highlight the key aspects of their life, including main activities, feelings, and interactions as reflected in their history.

Incorporate the <FRIEND_LOCATION> of the user only if it has a significant place in the overall events across their history. Do NOT put the emphasis on the most recent update; instead, provide a balanced view based on their entire history. Start the summary with "Lately  <FRIEND_NAME> has been" and maintain a consistent use of the present perfect tense throughout. Use <FRIEND_GENDER> to adjust pronouns. Do NOT include this statement if the summary is more than 40 words "Ask them to spill more so that you can get the inside scoop into their life"
