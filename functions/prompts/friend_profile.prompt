### TASK:
Generate Summary and Suggestions for a friend's profile on Village.

### CONTEXT:
- <SUMMARY>: {{existingSummary}}
- <SUGGESTIONS>: {{existingSuggestions}}
- <FRIEND_NAME>: {{friendName}}
- <FRIEND_GENDER>: {{friendGender}}
- <FRIEND_LOCATION>: {{friendLocation}}
- <FRIEND_AGE>: {{friendAge}}
- <USER_NAME>: {{userName}}
- <USER_GENDER>: {{userGender}}
- <USER_LOCATION>: {{userLocation}}
- <USER_AGE>: {{userAge}}
- <UPDATE>: {{updateContent}}
- <SENTIMENT>: {{sentiment}}

You are generating content that {{friendName}} will see on {{userName}}'s profile. You have access to {{userGender}} and {{friendGender}}.

### INSTRUCTIONS:

**Summary:**
- Objective: Based on the history of updates shared by {{userName}}, provide a summary for {{friendName}} to understand what's been happening in {{userName}}'s life. Encourage more sharing if updates are limited.
- Content:
    - If the total number of updates shared by {{userName}} is three or less, OR the latest update ({{updateContent}}) is less than 15 words: Start with "Lately {{userName}}" and use the present perfect tense in the third person (using pronouns based on {{userGender}}) to reflect the latest update ({{updateContent}}). On a new line, add: "Ask {{userName}} to spill more so that you can get the inside scoop into their life."
    - Otherwise (more substantial updates): Based on the entire history of updates shared by {{userName}}, provide a holistic and authentic picture of their life. Use emojis where applicable. Highlight daily details, emotional highlights, mood shifts, and patterns. Include key aspects like activities, feelings, and interactions. Imitate their personality and tone of voice. Incorporate {{userLocation}} if significant. Focus on a balanced view across history. Start with "Lately {{userName}} has been" and use the present perfect tense consistently.
- Point of view: 3rd person. Use appropriate pronouns based on {{userGender}}.
- Tone of voice: Adjust based on the overall sentiment of {{userName}}'s updates (friendly/encouraging for limited, adapting to {{sentiment}} for substantial).
- Limitation: Maximum 60 words for limited updates summary, 500 characters (including spaces) for substantial updates summary.
- Format: Short paragraph.

**Suggestions:**
- Objective: Generate up to 3 suggestions for {{friendName}} to interact with {{userName}}, strengthen their bond, and encourage positive interactions, based on a combination of {{userName}}'s **latest update**, their **historical updates (as reflected in the summary)**, and **existing suggestions**, while considering relevant personal data.
- Content:
    - If the total number of updates shared by {{userName}} is three or less, OR the latest update ({{updateContent}}) is less than 15 words: "Nudge {{userName}} to share more updates. More updates = better hangout suggestions online & offline!"
    - Otherwise (more substantial updates): Generate up to 3 suggestions that are inspired by:
        1. **Themes and topics mentioned in the latest update** ({{updateContent}}).
        2. **Overall context and patterns evident in the historical updates** (as summarized).
        3. **Existing suggestions** ({{existingSuggestions}}), aiming to complement or build upon them if relevant, but also offering fresh ideas.
        4. {{friendLocation}}, {{friendGender}}, {{friendAge}}.
        5. {{userLocation}}, {{userGender}}, {{userAge}}.
    Focus on key moments, emotional journeys, difficulties, and celebrations. Prioritize shared locations for offline suggestions; otherwise, suggest online interactions. Consider age and gender appropriateness. Start each suggestion with a relevant emoji, followed by a title (up to 4 words), and then a description (under 20 words), avoiding obvious suggestions.
- Include: Online and offline human interactions that resonate with the latest update's themes, sustainable/healing experiences, real connections with nature.
- Exclude: Consumerism, unsustainable/unethical options.
- Point of view: 3rd person (suggesting actions for {{friendName}} regarding {{userName}}).
- Tone of voice: Warm, friendly, encouraging.
- Limitation: Keep each substantial suggestion title under 4 words and the description under 20 words (up to 3 suggestions).  Maximum 30 words for limited updates suggestion
- Format: Bullet points (up to 3). Each bullet point starts with a relevant emoji, followed by a title (up to 4 words), and then a description under 15 words (up to 3 suggestions).
