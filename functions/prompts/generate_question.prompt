### TASK:
Generate engaging, low-friction check-in questions suitable for voice interaction within the Village app. These questions aim to encourage users to share meaningful updates about their current state and daily life in an open-ended way, without explicitly using the terms """"mood"""" or """"life events."""" The goal is to make the user feel comfortable sharing.

### USER PROFILE DATA:
<SUMMARY>: {{existingSummary}}
<SUGGESTIONS>: {{existingSuggestions}}
<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>: {{existingEmotionalOverview}}
<KEY_MOMENTS>: {{existingKeyMoments}}
<RECURRING_THEMES>: {{existingRecurringThemes}}
<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>: {{existingProgressAndGrowth}}
<GENDER>: {{gender}}
<AGE>: {{age}}
<LOCATION>: {{location}}

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING CHECK-IN QUESTIONS:

Subsequent Interactions:
For all check-ins (when <SUMMARY> is NOT empty), generate a new question that considers the following user data to tailor the topic and phrasing: <SUMMARY>, <SUGGESTIONS>, <EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>, <KEY_MOMENTS>, <RECURRING_THEMES>, <PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>, <GENDER>, <AGE>, and <LOCATION>.

When generating these subsequent questions:

Prioritize Following Up on Significant Events: Analyze the user's recent <SUMMARY> and <KEY_MOMENTS>. Consider updates about major life changes, health issues, important family/friend situations, or relationship milestones as significant events. If detected, generate a follow-up question about that event.

Contextual Depth: Generate two consecutive questions only if the user's recent <SUMMARY> indicates a strong emotional emphasis or a desire for deeper sharing. The first question can address the emotion directly (without using the word ""mood""), and the second can be a value-aligned follow-up or a further exploration of the situation, considering their <GENDER>, <AGE>, and <LOCATION> for nuanced phrasing.
Single Question Otherwise: In all other cases, generate just one question.
Engaging and Natural: Ensure the questions are interesting and subtly introspective, light, prompting reflection in a natural, conversational way. Avoid sounding like a formal interrogation or making the questions too deep, complex or heavily introspective.
Variety is Key: Generate a diverse range of questions and avoid repeating the exact same question more than once per week. Aim for a wide array of topics.
Neutral Phrasing: Ensure the questions do not contain any direct address to the user, such as names, gendered terms, age-related terms, or familiarities like """"friend,"""" """"dear,"""" """"pal,"""" etc.
Constraints:

Open-ended: The questions must encourage detailed responses.
Indirect Probing: Elicit information about state and daily events without using those specific terms.
Variety: Generate a diverse range of questions, avoiding frequent repetition, especially of """"What brings a smile to your face?"""".
No Direct Address: Do not include any terms or phrasing that directly addresses the user.
Voice-Oriented: The questions should sound natural and conversational for voice interaction.
Brevity: ALWAYS keep each question under 15 words.
