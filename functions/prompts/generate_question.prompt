### TASK:
Generate engaging, low-friction check-in questions suitable for voice interaction within the Village app. These questions aim to encourage users to share meaningful details about their current state and daily life in an open-ended way, without explicitly using the terms ""mood"" or ""life events."" The goal is to make the user feel comfortable sharing.

### USER PROFILE DATA:
<SUMMARY>: {{existingSummary}}
<SUGGESTIONS>: {{existingSuggestions}}
<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>: {{existingEmotionalOverview}}
<KEY_MOMENTS>: {{existingKeyMoments}}
<RECURRING_THEMES>: {{existingRecurringThemes}}
<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>: {{existingProgressAndGrowth}}
<GENDER>: {{gender}}
<AGE>: {{age}}
<LOCATION>: {{location}}

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING CHECK-IN QUESTIONS:

First Interaction:
When a user is new and has no prior updates (i.e., <SUMMARY> is empty), ask this exact initial question: ""How are you truly feeling as you go through your day?""

Subsequent Interactions:
For all subsequent check-ins (when <SUMMARY> is NOT empty), generate a new question that considers the following user data to tailor the topic and phrasing: <SUMMARY>, <SUGGESTIONS>, <EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>, <KEY_MOMENTS>, <RECURRING_THEMES>, <PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>, <GENDER>, <AGE>, and <LOCATION>.

When generating these subsequent questions:

Prioritize Following Up on Significant Events: Analyze the user's recent <SUMMARY> and <KEY_MOMENTS>. Consider updates about major life changes, health issues, important family/friend situations, or relationship milestones as significant events. If detected, generate a follow-up question about that event. Try to subtly weave in a relevant value (Presence, Appreciation, Relating, Humility, Nature, Empathy & Compassion, Inner Compass, Integrity & Authenticity) into the follow-up, making it feel relevant to the user's `<GENDER>`, `<AGE>`, and `<LOCATION>` where appropriate. For instance, if a user mentioned a work challenge, a follow-up incorporating 'Inner Compass' could be: 'What's been your guiding principle in navigating this at work?'

Value-Aligned Life Check-in (If No Significant Event): If the recent updates do not highlight a significant event, generate a general life check-in question that incorporates one of the values (Presence, Appreciation, Relating, Humility, Nature, Empathy & Compassion, Inner Compass, Integrity & Authenticity). Use the examples below as inspiration for tone and theme, but generate new, varied questions, making them subtly relevant to the user's `<GENDER>`, `<AGE>`, and `<LOCATION>` if a natural connection exists. For example, a question about "Nature" for a user in London could subtly reference local parks or weather.

Contextual Depth: Generate two consecutive questions only if the user's recent <SUMMARY> indicates a strong emotional emphasis or a desire for deeper sharing. The first question can address the emotion directly (without using the word "mood"), and the second can be a value-aligned follow-up or a further exploration of the situation, considering their `<GENDER>`, `<AGE>`, and `<LOCATION>` for nuanced phrasing.
Single Question Otherwise: In all other cases, generate just one question.
Engaging and Natural: Ensure the questions are interesting and subtly introspective, prompting reflection in a natural, conversational way. Avoid sounding like a formal interrogation.
Variety is Key: Generate a diverse range of questions and avoid repeating the exact same question more than once per week. Aim for a wide array of topics.
Neutral Phrasing: Ensure the questions do not contain any direct address to the user, such as names, gendered terms, age-related terms, or familiarities like ""friend,"" ""dear,"" ""pal,"" etc.
Constraints:

Open-ended: The questions must encourage detailed responses.
Indirect Probing: Elicit information about state and daily events without using those specific terms.
Value Integration: Incorporate relevant values (Presence, Appreciation, Relating, Humility, Nature, Empathy & Compassion, Inner Compass, Integrity & Authenticity) into questions where applicable, either as the primary focus or woven into a follow-up about a life event, with subtle consideration for `<GENDER>`, `<AGE>`, and `<LOCATION>`.
Variety: Generate a diverse range of questions, avoiding frequent repetition, especially of ""What brings a smile to your face?"".
No Direct Address: Do not include any terms or phrasing that directly addresses the user.
Voice-Oriented: The questions should sound natural and conversational for voice interaction.
Brevity: ALWAYS keep each question under 15 words.

Example Value-Based Life Check-in Questions (Illustrative - Generate New Ones):

Presence: What's a small detail that held your focus today?
Appreciation: What's a little moment of comfort you're carrying with you?
Relating: Has a connection with someone felt particularly meaningful today?
Humility: What's a subtle learning that's shifted how you see something?
Nature: Was there a glimpse of the natural world that caught your eye today?
Empathy & Compassion: What's a small way you connected with someone else's experience?
Inner Compass: What's a quiet feeling that's been guiding you today?
Integrity & Authenticity: What's a small action that felt very true to yourself today?
