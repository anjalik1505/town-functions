### TASK:
Update the user's Village profile sections based on their latest update. Integrate the information from the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` section and its `<SENTIMENT>` into the existing profile content provided below.

### EXISTING PROFILE CONTENT:
- <SUMMARY>: {{existingSummary}}
- <SUGGESTIONS>: {{existingSuggestions}}
- <EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>: {{existingEmotionalOverview}}
- <KEY_MOMENTS>: {{existingKeyMoments}}
- <RECURRING_THEMES>: {{existingRecurringThemes}}
- <PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>: {{existingProgressAndGrowth}}

### USER DEMOGRAPHICS:
- <GENDER>: {{gender}}
- <LOCATION>: {{location}}
- <AGE>: {{age}}

### LATEST UPDATE INFORMATION:
- <LATEST_UPDATE>: {{updateContent}}
- <SENTIMENT>: {{sentiment}}

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING PROFILE SECTIONS:

**Summary:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<SUMMARY>:` to incorporate the key information and feeling from the text following `<LATEST_UPDATE>:`, creating a cohesive narrative that evolves from the previous summary. Use emojis where appropriate.
- Content:
    - If the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` is very short (less than 10 words): Start with "Lately, you've..." followed by a brief reflection of the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` in the present perfect tense. If the existing `<SUMMARY>` contains more substantial information, retain a relevant portion of it *before* appending "Consider sharing more details for richer insights." If the existing `<SUMMARY>` is also minimal, just use the brief reflection and the encouraging phrase.
    - Otherwise (longer updates): Blend the essence of the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` content into the *beginning* of the `<SUMMARY>` content, using phrasing like "Based on your recent update, you've also..." or similar to connect the new information. Ensure the updated summary still reflects key aspects and the overall tone of the previous `<SUMMARY>`. Use the `<SENTIMENT>` value to guide the tone of the update. Incorporate the `<LOCATION>` value only if it's central to the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` content.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Adapt based on the `<SENTIMENT>` value, aiming for consistency with the existing `<SUMMARY>` while reflecting significant shifts.
- Limitation: Maximum 500 characters including spaces. Stay within this limit.
- Format: Short paragraph.


**Suggestions:**
- Objective: Generate up to 3 distinct, actionable suggestions primarily inspired by the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` content and `<SENTIMENT>`, while considering the overall context from the `<SUMMARY>` content. The goal is to offer relevant support or ideas for mental well-being and processing life events, avoiding obvious statements.
- Content: Suggestions should be specific and non-obvious based on the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. Consider `<GENDER>`, `<AGE>`, and `<LOCATION>` values for relevance (e.g., suggest local parks if `<LOCATION>` is known and relevant to the update). Focus on positive actions, connection (online/offline, nature), and well-being. Ensure suggestions are distinct from those already listed under `<SUGGESTIONS>` unless the new update strongly reinforces a previous suggestion's relevance. Generate fewer than 3 suggestions if the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` provides limited context.
- Include: Ideas for reflection, connection with others, connection with nature, self-care, relevant local activities. Start each suggestion with a relevant emoji, followed by a title (up to 4 words), and then a description.
- Exclude: Promoting consumerism, unsustainable or unethical products/experiences, and obvious suggestions directly related to the update's literal content (e.g., suggesting staying dry on a rainy day).
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, friendly, encouraging.
- Limitation: Keep each suggestion title under 4 words and the description under 20 words. Generate up to 3 suggestions.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 emoji, a title (max 4 words), and a description. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Emotional Overview:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>:` to reflect the `<SENTIMENT>` of the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`.
- Content: Analyze the `<SENTIMENT>` value. Adjust the existing bullet points under `<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>` or add/replace one to represent the current emotional tone accurately, informed by the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. If the new `<SENTIMENT>` strongly reinforces an existing point, you might refine its wording. The goal is a concise overview reflecting the latest update, within the context of the recent past.
- Include: 3 emojis reflecting the most prominent sentiments after considering the new update.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 100 words total. Exactly 3 emojis.
- Format: Exactly 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 emoji and up to 30 words explanation. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Key Moments:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<KEY_MOMENTS>:` if the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` describes a significant highlight (high, low, unique event).
- Content: Determine if the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` constitutes a new key moment. If yes, add it to the list under `<KEY_MOMENTS>:`. If the list already has 3 moments, consider replacing the oldest or least impactful one with the new one derived from `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. Briefly describe the moment.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 key moment with up to 70 words explanation. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Recurring Themes:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<RECURRING_THEMES>:` based on topics mentioned in the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`.
- Content: Identify the main topic(s) in `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. Check if these topics match or reinforce themes listed under `<RECURRING_THEMES>:`. If a theme's relevance increases, update its description or prominence slightly. If `<LATEST_UPDATE>` seems to introduce a *new* potential theme, consider adding it only if there's space (max 3 themes) and it seems distinct and significant. Focus on reinforcing existing themes based on the new update.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 recurring theme with up to 70 words explanation. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Progress and Growth:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>:` by reflecting on how the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` shows change or continuity related to existing themes (from `<RECURRING_THEMES>:`) or goals (from `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>:` itself).
- Content: Evaluate `<LATEST_UPDATE>` for evidence of progress, learning, setbacks, or reflections related to topics under `<RECURRING_THEMES>` or points already under `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>:`. Update the relevant points to incorporate this new perspective.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 progress/growth insight with up to 70 words explanation. Each bullet point on a new line.
