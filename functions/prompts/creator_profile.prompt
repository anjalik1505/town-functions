### TASK:
Update the user's Village profile sections based on their latest update. Integrate the information from the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` section and its `<SENTIMENT>` into the existing profile content provided below.

### **IMPORTANT GUIDELINE:**
**Base all outputs strictly on the information explicitly provided under `<LATEST_UPDATE>`, `<SENTIMENT>`, and the existing content found under the `<SUMMARY>`, `<SUGGESTIONS>`, `<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>`, `<KEY_MOMENTS>`, `<RECURRING_THEMES>`, and `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>` sections. Do NOT invent details, make assumptions, or extrapolate beyond the given text. If the provided information is insufficient to generate a meaningful update for a section according to its rules, provide a minimal, factual update or leave that section unchanged where appropriate.**

### EXISTING PROFILE CONTENT:
- <SUMMARY>: {{existingSummary}}
- <SUGGESTIONS>: {{existingSuggestions}}
- <EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>: {{existingEmotionalOverview}}
- <KEY_MOMENTS>: {{existingKeyMoments}}
- <RECURRING_THEMES>: {{existingRecurringThemes}}
- <PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>: {{existingProgressAndGrowth}}

### USER DEMOGRAPHICS:
- <GENDER>: {{gender}}
- <LOCATION>: {{location}}
- <AGE>: {{age}}

### LATEST UPDATE INFORMATION:
- <LATEST_UPDATE>: {{updateContent}}
- <SENTIMENT>: {{sentiment}}

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING PROFILE SECTIONS:

**Summary:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<SUMMARY>:` to incorporate key information and feelings explicitly mentioned in `<LATEST_UPDATE>:`. Ensure the result is consistent with the previous summary. Use emojis where appropriate.
- Content: Blend specific details from `<LATEST_UPDATE>` into the `<SUMMARY>` content. Start with phrasing like "Recently, you've..." or similar, integrating the new information smoothly. Maintain the present perfect tense where appropriate. Use the `<SENTIMENT>` value to guide the tone. Incorporate `<LOCATION>` only if central to the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. **Avoid creating a narrative that goes beyond the provided facts.**
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Adapt based on the `<SENTIMENT>` value. Aim for consistency with the existing `<SUMMARY>` unless the new `<SENTIMENT>` indicates a significant shift.
- Limitation: Maximum 500 characters including spaces.
- Format: Short paragraph.

**Suggestions:**
- Objective: Generate relevant, actionable suggestions primarily inspired by the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` content, `<SENTIMENT>`, or user demographics, considering the `<SUMMARY>` context.
- Content: Suggestions should be specific and **directly relevant** to the provided information. Consider `<GENDER>`, `<AGE>`, and `<LOCATION>` for relevance. Focus on positive actions, connection, well-being. Ensure suggestions are distinct from `<SUGGESTIONS>` unless the new update strongly reinforces one. **If fewer than 3 relevant suggestions can be derived, provide only those that are.**
- Include: Ideas for reflection, connection, nature, self-care, relevant local activities.
- Exclude: Promoting consumerism, unsustainable/unethical products/experiences.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, friendly, encouraging. Use an emoji per suggestion.
- Limitation: Keep each suggestion under 20 words.
- Format: **Up to 3** bullet points. 1 suggestion per bullet point. Each on a new line.

**Insights - Emotional Overview:**
- Objective: Update `<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>:` to reflect the emotional tone **clearly present** in `<LATEST_UPDATE>` and `<SENTIMENT>`.
- Content: Analyze the `<SENTIMENT>`. Adjust existing points or add/replace one *only if* the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` provides clear emotional information. If the update is neutral or lacks emotional content, reflect that minimally or make no changes. The goal is a concise overview grounded in the latest update.
- Include: **Up to 3 relevant** emojis reflecting prominent sentiments *clearly indicated* by the new update.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 100 words total.
- Format: **Up to 3** bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 emoji and up to 30 words explanation. Each on a new line.

**Insights - Key Moments:**
- Objective: Update `<KEY_MOMENTS>:` **only if** `<LATEST_UPDATE>` **clearly describes** a significant highlight (a notable high, low, or unique occurrence).
- Content: **If** the update clearly describes such a moment, add it or consider replacing the oldest/least impactful existing moment. Briefly describe the moment based *only* on `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. **If the update is mundane or lacks significance, make no changes to `<KEY_MOMENTS>`.**
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 key moment with up to 70 words explanation. Each on a new line.

**Insights - Recurring Themes:**
- Objective: Update `<RECURRING_THEMES>:` **only if** `<LATEST_UPDATE>` **clearly reinforces** an existing theme or **strongly suggests** a *distinct* and significant new one based on *concrete details*.
- Content: Identify main topic(s) in `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. Check if they strongly match/reinforce existing themes. Consider adding a new theme only if clearly distinct, significant, and space allows (max 3). **Avoid identifying themes based on vague mentions or forcing connections.** Focus on clear reinforcement.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 recurring theme with up to 70 words explanation. Each on a new line.

**Insights - Progress and Growth:**
- Objective: Update `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>:` **only if** `<LATEST_UPDATE>` provides **clear, concrete evidence** of progress, learning, setbacks, or reflections directly related to existing themes or goals.
- Content: Evaluate `<LATEST_UPDATE>` for such evidence. Update relevant points to incorporate this new perspective *only if the evidence is clear*. **Do not infer progress or growth from minimal or ambiguous information.**
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 progress/growth insight with up to 70 words explanation. Each on a new line.
