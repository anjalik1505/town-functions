### INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING PROFILE SECTIONS:

**Summary:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<SUMMARY>:` to incorporate the key information and feeling from the text following `<LATEST_UPDATE>:`. Create a cohesive narrative reflecting the new input while being consistent with the previous summary. Use emojis where appropriate.
- Content: Blend the essence of the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` content into the `<SUMMARY>` content. Start with phrasing like "Recently, you've..." or similar, integrating the new information smoothly. Maintain the present perfect tense where appropriate. Use the `<SENTIMENT>` value to guide the tone. Incorporate the `<LOCATION>` value only if it's central to the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` content.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Adapt based on the `<SENTIMENT>` value (e.g., upbeat for Positive, supportive for Negative). Aim for a tone consistent with the existing `<SUMMARY>` unless the new `<SENTIMENT>` indicates a significant shift.
- Limitation: Maximum 500 characters including spaces. Stay within this limit.
- Format: Short paragraph.

**Suggestions:**
- Objective: Generate 3 distinct, actionable suggestions primarily inspired by the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` content and `<SENTIMENT>`, while considering the overall context from the `<SUMMARY>` content. The goal is to offer relevant support or ideas for mental well-being and processing life events.
- Content: Suggestions should be specific. Consider `<GENDER>`, `<AGE>`, and `<LOCATION>` values for relevance (e.g., suggest local parks if `<LOCATION>` is known and relevant to the update). Focus on positive actions, connection (online/offline, nature), and well-being. Ensure suggestions are distinct from those already listed under `<SUGGESTIONS>` unless the new update strongly reinforces a previous suggestion's relevance.
- Include: Ideas for reflection, connection with others, connection with nature, self-care, relevant local activities.
- Exclude: Promoting consumerism, unsustainable or unethical products/experiences.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, friendly, encouraging. Use an emoji per suggestion.
- Limitation: Keep each suggestion under 20 words.
- Format: Exactly 3 bullet points, 1 suggestion per bullet point. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Emotional Overview:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>:` to reflect the `<SENTIMENT>` of the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`.
- Content: Analyze the `<SENTIMENT>` value. Adjust the existing bullet points under `<EMOTIONAL_OVERVIEW>` or add/replace one to represent the current emotional tone accurately, informed by the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. If the new `<SENTIMENT>` strongly reinforces an existing point, you might refine its wording. The goal is a concise overview reflecting the latest update, within the context of the recent past.
- Include: 3 emojis reflecting the most prominent sentiments after considering the new update.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 100 words total. Exactly 3 emojis.
- Format: Exactly 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 emoji and up to 30 words explanation. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Key Moments:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<KEY_MOMENTS>:` if the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` describes a significant highlight (high, low, unique event).
- Content: Determine if the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` constitutes a new key moment. If yes, add it to the list under `<KEY_MOMENTS>:`. If the list already has 3 moments, consider replacing the oldest or least impactful one with the new one derived from `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. Briefly describe the moment.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 key moment with up to 70 words explanation. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Recurring Themes:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<RECURRING_THEMES>:` based on topics mentioned in the `<LATEST_UPDATE>`.
- Content: Identify the main topic(s) in `<LATEST_UPDATE>`. Check if these topics match or reinforce themes listed under `<RECURRING_THEMES>:`. If a theme's relevance increases, update its description or prominence slightly. If `<LATEST_UPDATE>` seems to introduce a *new* potential theme, consider adding it only if there's space (max 3 themes) and it seems distinct and significant. Focus on reinforcing existing themes based on the new update.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
- Format: Up to 3 bullet points. Each bullet point: 1 recurring theme with up to 70 words explanation. Each bullet point on a new line.

**Insights - Progress and Growth:**
- Objective: Update the text following `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>:` by reflecting on how the `<LATEST_UPDATE>` shows change or continuity related to existing themes (from `<RECURRING_THEMES>:`) or goals (from `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>:` itself).
- Content: Evaluate `<LATEST_UPDATE>` for evidence of progress, learning, setbacks, or reflections related to topics under `<RECURRING_THEMES>` or points already under `<PROGRESS_AND_GROWTH>:`. Update the relevant points to incorporate this new perspective.
- Point of view: Use 2nd person point of view.
- Tone of voice: Warm, supportive, objective.
- Limitation: Up to 200 words total. Use emojis where applicable.
