Village API Deletion Automation Script

This script automates API calls to the Village Firebase emulator for testing deletion functionality.
It creates users, authenticates them, and performs various operations to test the deletion process:
- Create two users
- Connect them as friends
- First user creates an additional invitation
- First user creates an update
- First user updates a device
- First user gets deleted
- Wait a bit
- Check second user's feed that no items are there
- Check second user's friends are empty
- Check in DB directly that updates, feed items, device, and invitation are non-existent
